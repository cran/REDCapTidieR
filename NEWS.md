# REDCapTidieR 0.4.1

Version 0.4.1 (Unreleased)
==========================================================

## Miscellaneous

* Updated test suite to be compatible with REDCapR 1.2.0

# REDCapTidieR 0.4.0

Version 0.4.0 (Released 2023-06-02)
==========================================================

## New Features

* Introduces new functions `add_skimr_metadata()` and `write_redcap_xlsx()` with supporting documentation
* `read_redcap()` now supports Data Access Groups (DAGs)
   * New argument available to `read_redcap()`: `export_data_access_groups`

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where REDCapR API error messages weren't being returned from REDCapTidieR

## Miscellaneous

* All deprecated functions have been officially retired and removed from the package

# REDCapTidieR 0.3.0

Version 0.3.0 (Released 2023-03-17)
==========================================================

## New Features

* `read_redcap()` now supports projects with repeating events which introduced a **breaking change** to data tibble column names
  * `redcap_repeat_instance` is now `redcap_form_instance`
  * `redcap_event_instance` has been added to denote repeating events

## Performance Improvements and Enhancements

* Improved error message suite:
  * Helpful error message provided for various conditions related to REDCap API calls
  * Helpful error messages added for checks across all exported functions
  * Unexpected error messages provided with direction to submitting bug reports
    * Improved error messages for label parsing
  * Added `select_choices_and_calculations` exported by the REDCap API to `redcap_metadata` tibble
* Improved process for adding/updating `httptest` mocks

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where the `suppress_redcapr_messages` argument for `read_redcap()` was not working appropriately
* Fixed a bug where `read_redcap()` would fail when `select_choices_and_calculations` was missing whitespace after commas (discovered by @camcaan)
* Fixed a bug where `read_redcap()` would fail for projects with a multiple choice field having duplicate values with the same label
  * Added a warning when REDCapTidieR detects this
* Fixed a bug where empty rows would appear in data tibbles in longitudinal REDCap exports for events containing a mix of empty and filled forms
* Fixed a bug where the `forms` specification in `read_redcap()` may lead to incorrect removal of data for databases with repeating events

Version 0.2.0 (Released 2022-12-07)
==========================================================

### New Features

* Function name changes:
  * `read_redcap_tidy()` is now `read_redcap()`
  * `extract_table()` is now `extract_tibble()`
  * `extract_tables()` is now `extract_tibbles()`
  * `bind_table()` is now `bind_tibbles()`
    * All old functions are still supported and throw a deprecation warning
* Instrument/form-level metadata included in supertibble output:
  * `redcap_form_label`: The instrumentâ€™s human-readable label
  * `redcap_metadata`: REDCap metadata associated with the instrument (derived from `REDCapR::redcap_metadata_read()`)
  * `redcap_events`: Events and arms associated with this instrument (for longitudinal projects only)
  * `data_rows`, `data_cols`: Row and column counts of `redcap_data`
  * `data_size`: Size of the `redcap_data` tibble in memory
  * `data_na_pct`: The percentage of missing data in the `redcap_data` tibble
* New `make_labelled()` function that attaches variable labels using the [labelled](https://larmarange.github.io/labelled/) package
* New arguments available `read_redcap()`:
  * `forms`: Allows reading specific instruments instead of the whole project
  * `export_survey_fields`: Allows for export of `redcap_survey_timestamp` and `redcap_survey_identifier` columns from survey-enabled REDCap instruments (`TRUE` by default)

### Performance Improvements and Enhancements

* Improved execution time by >2.5X by optimizing internal functions `check_repeat_and_nonrepeat()`, `distill_*_table_long()`, and `multi_choice_to_labels()`
* New informative warning and error messages, now rendered using the [cli](https://cli.r-lib.org/) package
* Tests and vignettes now use [httptest](https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/) to mock and cache REDCap API calls
* Implemented GitHub Actions link check 
* Replaced deprecated `.data` pronoun in tidyselect expressions

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug in which similarly named variables could be duplicated under some circumstances
* Order of instruments in the supertibble is now the same as the order of instruments in REDCap
* Fixed an issue in which `extract_*()` functions under some circumstances returned `NULL` instead of the expected tibbles

Version 0.1.3 (Released 2022-10-03)
==========================================================

### Documentation Updates

* Fixed a bug where `clean_redcap()` may not correctly assign variables across instruments to their appropriate tables in cases of similar prefixes
